        <h2>About CS Games</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://csgames.org" target="_blank">CS Games</a> is an annual team programming competition. It is an exciting opportunity for undergraduate students
          to demonstrate their programming skills in representation of Guelph!
          The CS Games 2019 will be hosted by Polytechnique Montreal from March 22â€“24!
        </p>
        <p>
          The event is open to all University of Guelph undergraduate students in Computer Science &amp;
          Software Engineering. In the past, registration &amp; hotel cost has been covered by the SOCS
          department, transportation is the only cost involved.

        <h3>Last year's event</h3>
        <p>Last year SOCIS sent two (2) teams to the CS Games 2018 event, one junior and one senior team. This was the biggest group of students that SOCIS has sent in a long time, and it was a lot of fun! Challenges ranged from team software engineering, to reverse engineering and security, to sports and video games. It was held at U Laval in Quebec City.</p>
        <p>Transportation was organized for all 20 students who attended. The travel costs were approximately $150 per person.</p>
