          <a href="http://csgames.org/2015/en/" target="_blank">CS Games</a> is an annual programming competition. It is
          held this year at Sherbrooke University in Quebec. It is an exciting opportunity for undergraduate students
          to demonstrate their programming skills in representation of Guelph!
          <br><br>
          The event is open to all University of Guelph undergraduate students in Computer Science &
          Software Engineering. In the past, registration & hotel cost has been covered by the SOCS
          department, transportation is the only cost involved.
