              | Our Role in the School of Computer Science
            p.lead
              | Computer Science students have a voice inside the department and that voice is SOCIS.
              | At least one of our executives is at every department meeting giving input on the topics discussed at the meeting. This has far reaching affects on topics like the future curriculum provided to CS and S. ENG majors. We also help the department to run events like the annual SOCS barbeque held every year in September to help welcome first year CS students to the University.
