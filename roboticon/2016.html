          <h2>Challenge One Description</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>This year's theme is Star Wars!</p>
          <p>"The Empire has found our base! As we speak, the Death Star is making it's way around the gas giant to destroy Yavin 4! Thanks to efforts of others, we've found a weakness in the Death Star. A small thermal exhaust port exists, and firing into it has the potential of destroying Death Star. Now you must attack the Death Star, and navigate through the trench leading up to the exhaust port. Avoid any enemies you may encounter, and once you are in range, fire your torpedoes! May the Force be with you."</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The challenge area will be a corridor that is 3 feet wide and 12 feet long.</li>
            <li>The challenge area will have a wall on three sides, every side except the wall behind where the robot begins. This wall will be at minimum 3.5 inches tall.</li>
            <li>The robot will begin at the centre of one end the challenge area, and will have to navigate to the opposite end.</li>
            <li>Once at the opposite end, the robot will have to launch a small styrofoam ball between the two goal posts. (This will represent launching a proton torpedo into the exhaust port.)</li>
            <li>In between the two ends will be a series of obstacles:</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>10 Objects representing Turrets and TIE-Fighters will be placed at indeterminate points around the play area.</li>
              <li>Objects will be surrounded by a black area which will be 6 inches in radius.</li>
              <li>These black areas will be circles, with the Object in the centre of this circle.</li>
              <li>Black areas will be surrounded by a further grey buffer/warning zone, that will be 6 inches wide all around the black area.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>There will be start and end zones of open space, where no Objects will be placed. </li>
            <li>Completing the goal of launching the styrofoam ball through the goal posts will award 5 points. Each Object not knocked over will award 1 point.</li>
            <li>For an Object to be consider "not knocked over," the robot will have to have completely passed the Object (all parts of the robot past the Object's horizontal position.) Points to this effect will be counted based on the robot's position when the run ends.</li>
            <li>Teams will be ranked by total points and ties will be decided by time taken. </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Challenge Two Description</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>"Your brave ally has dove into the trench to make the run to destroy the Death Star. While they make their way to the exhaust port, it is imperative you and the rest of your squadron keep the Empire’s TIE Fighters off their backs. The battle is incredibly chaotic, making it very difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Destroy as many TIE Fighters as possible, but avoid friendly fire at all costs!"</p>
          <hr>
          <ol>
            <li>The challenge area will be 6 feet wide by 6 feet long, with a wall on all four sides.</li>
            <li>The robot will begin in a set position, facing a direction of the competitors’ choosing.The starting position is indeterminate, but will be the same for all competitors.</li>
            <li>There will again be a series of 10 circles distributed randomly around the play area.</li>
            <li>There are two types of circles, black circles and grey circles, five of each. All ten are 1 foot in diameter, and will have one of the same dowels as used in challenge 1 in the centre of each.</li>
            <li>Black circles will represent TIE Fighters, and grey circles will represent friendly X-Wings.</li>
            <li>Your robot is tasked with knocking over as many of the dowels in the centre of black circles, while simultaneously avoiding knocking over the dowels in the centre of grey circles.</li>
            <li>Scoring will be completed at the end of each run as such: Dowels in the centre of black circles (black dowels) will be worth 30 points each if knocked over. Dowels in the centre of grey circles (grey dowels) will be worth 5 points each if knocked over. For each grey dowel that is knocked over though, the number of points each black dowel is worth will be lowered by 6 points, to a minimum of 0 per black dowel. Maximum possible score is 150, minimum is 0, with 25 being the score of a team that knocks over all 5 grey dowels.</li>
            <li>Teams will be ranked by total points and ties will be decided by time taken. </li>
          </ol>
