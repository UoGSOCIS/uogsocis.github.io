          <h2>Challenge One Description</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>This year's theme is Star Wars!</p>
          <p>"The Empire has found our base! As we speak, the Death Star is making it's way around the gas giant to destroy Yavin 4! Thanks to efforts of others, we've found a weakness in the Death Star. A small thermal exhaust port exists, and firing into it has the potential of destroying Death Star. Now you must attack the Death Star, and navigate through the trench leading up to the exhaust port. Avoid any enemies you may encounter, and once you are in range, fire your torpedoes! May the Force be with you."</p>
          <hr>
          <ol>
            <li>The challenge area will be a corridor that is 3 feet wide and 12 feet long.</li>
            <li>The challenge area will have a wall on three sides, every side except the wall behind where the robot begins. This wall will be at minimum 3.5 inches tall.</li>
            <li>The robot will begin at the centre of one end the challenge area, and will have to navigate to the opposite end.</li>
            <li>Once at the opposite end, the robot will have to launch a small styrofoam ball between the two goal posts. (This will represent launching a proton torpedo into the exhaust port.)</li>
            <li>In between the two ends will be a series of obstacles:</li>
            <ol type="a">
            	<li>10 Objects representing Turrets and TIE-Fighters will be placed at indeterminate points around the play area.</li>
            	<li>Objects will be surrounded by a black area which will be 6 inches in radius.</li>
            	<li>These black areas will be circles, with the Object in the centre of this circle.</li>
            	<li>Black areas will be surrounded by a further grey buffer/warning zone, that will be 6 inches wide all around the black area.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>There will be start and end zones of open space, where no Objects will be placed. </li>
            <li>Completing the goal of launching the styrofoam ball through the goal posts will award 5 points. Each Object not knocked over will award 1 point.</li>
            <li>For an Object to be consider "not knocked over," the robot will have to have completely passed the Object (all parts of the robot past the Object's horizontal position.) Points to this effect will be counted based on the robot's position when the run ends.</li>
            <li>Teams will be ranked by total points and ties will be decided by time taken. </li>
          </ol>

            <li>Teams may only use parts from their kits.</li>

        <h2>Challenge Two Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The challenge area will be a 5 foot by 6 foot area enclosed by a 6 foot
            by 6 foot wall, characterised by a 5 by 6 grid of 1 foot by 1 foot squares
            of varying colour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robots must navigate up one of the five columns (starting on a neutral tile)
            while reading a binary number from the grid beneath themselves, with digits being
            represented by white for 0 and grey for 1.
          </li>
          <li>
              Robot are to navigate the play area and determine which binary number is the largest
              and then park in the column containing that number.
          </li>
          <li>
              Numbers are to be determined by reading from bottom to top, a in the example
              given in the challenge area description.
          </li>
          <li>
              Bottom of the play area should be considered the side of the area the robot
              starts in.
          </li>
          <li>
              If a number is present more than once, priority is given to the left-most
              of the group. Left and right should be relative to which side is the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
              In this case, the numbers ARE NOT guaranteed to form a path through all
              five columns if you use your path finding from challenge one.
          </li>
          <li>
              To park, the robot must come to a complete stop and sound a beep for one second.
          </li>
          <li>
              The column the robot is on once parked will be the column the light sensor is on
          </li>
          <li>
              The program you with the judge to run MUST be in the first slot. The judge will not run
              any other program for any reason.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <hr class="grey">
        <p>
          The grid squares in the challenge area will be one of three colours: white, grey, and black.
          In the play area there will be three parts. See diagram.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Run-off: 6 inch wide run-off on either side of the main area.</li>
          <li>
            Neutral area: A row where squares will alternate in colour so as to make counting columns
            straightforward. There is one at both the top and bottom of a column, framing the active area.
            Note that the order in which colours alternate is not fixed, nor is any given neutral area
            guaranteed to use all three colours. The neutral area may not appear as it does in the diagram.
          </li>
          <li>
            Active area: Four squares framed by the neutral area which represent a 4-bit binary number.
            Digits in this number will be represented by white for 0 and grey for 1. The number is to be
            read first digit first; that is, the first digit read from the play area is the first digit in the
            binary number.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          So, from the example diagram, if we read from bottom to top: Column 1 is 1001, Column 2 is 1110,
          Column 3 is 0101, Column 4 is 1110, and Column 5 is 1011.
        </p>

          Challenge details are subject to minor change as ambiguities are eliminated and any concerns raised.

        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The challenge area will be a 5 foot by 6 foot area enclosed by a 6 foot
            by 6 foot wall, characterised by a 5 by 6 grid of 1 foot by 1 foot squares
            of varying colour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robots must navigate up one of the five columns (starting on a neutral tile)
            while reading a binary number from the grid beneath themselves, with digits being
            represented by white for 0 and grey for 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the robot reaches the end of column, it will need to turn. If the number read
            is divisible by either 3 or 4, the robot will turn left and travel down the next column to
            its left; otherwise, the robot will turn right and travel down the next column to its right.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robots must only travel each single column one time. If the next column it has been instructed
            to travel down has been traversed already, the robot must successfully continue traveling
            left/right until it reaches a column it has not yet traveled down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the robot has traveled down all five columns, it must come to a complete stop in a neutral area.
          </li>
          <li>
            The robot will always start in the centre column facing in a predetermined direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scores will be tallied based on the number of columns successfully traveled in the correct
            direction and correct order. Ties will be decided by time taken.
          </li>
        </ol>
