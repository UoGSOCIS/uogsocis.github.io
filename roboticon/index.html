        <p>
          Roboticon is back for 2016 at College Royal at the University of Guelph! The University of Guelph would like to invite you to Roboticon 2016. This year's robot-building and programming challenge will be occurring on <b>Saturday, March 19<sup>th</sup> &amp; Sunday, March 20<sup>th</sup>, 2016 at the University of Guelph</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/" >School of Computer Science</a>. It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Our First Place winners will receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and we will be giving away Second and Third Place LEGO gift card prizes! New this year, we will also be giving away raffle prizes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This event is open to <b>all high school students!</b> Roboticon is a completely free event to attend, The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits to teams that register. All meals will be provided. Get a team and a teacher together to register your team!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Teams of up to four high-school students will build and program
          robots using LEGO Mindstorms kits to compete in two challenges</li>
          <li>The first challenge will be posted below, so students will have the
          opportunity to get a head start on designs</li>
          <li>Upon arrival, the students will have time to build and test their
          designs on our practice track</li>
          <li>There will be two heats for the first challenge, with build time in
          between for students to tweak and update their designs</li>
          <li>The second challenge will be presented at the end of the first day
          of competition, with two heats occurring on the second day</li>
          <li>Winners and prizes will be announced!</li>

        <h2>Challenge One Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This year's theme is Star Wars!</p>
        <p>"The Empire has found our base! As we speak, the Death Star is making it's way around the gas giant to destroy Yavin 4! Thanks to efforts of others, we've found a weakness in the Death Star. A small thermal exhaust port exists, and firing into it has the potential of destroying Death Star. Now you must attack the Death Star, and navigate through the trench leading up to the exhaust port. Avoid any enemies you may encounter, and once you are in range, fire your torpedoes! May the Force be with you."</p> 
        <hr>  
        <ol>
          <li>The challenge area will be a corridor that is 3 feet wide and 12 feet long.</li>
          <li>The challenge area will have a wall on three sides, every side except the wall behind where the robot begins. This wall will be at minimum 3.5 inches tall.</li>
          <li>The robot will begin at the centre of one end the challenge area, and will have to navigate to the opposite end.</li>
          <li>Once at the opposite end, the robot will have to launch a small styrofoam ball between the two goal posts. (This will represent launching a proton torpedo into the exhaust port.)</li>
          <li>In between the two ends will be a series of obstacles:</li>
          <ol type="a">
          	<li>10 Objects representing Turrets and TIE-Fighters will be placed at indeterminate points around the play area.</li>
          	<li>Objects will be surrounded by a black area which will be 6 inches in radius.</li>
          	<li>These black areas will be circles, with the Object in the centre of this circle.</li>
          	<li>Black areas will be surrounded by a further grey buffer/warning zone, that will be 6 inches wide all around the black area.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>There will be start and end zones of open space, where no Objects will be placed. </li>
          <li>Completing the goal of launching the styrofoam ball through the goal posts will award 5 points. Each Object not knocked over will award 1 point.</li>
          <li>For an Object to be consider "not knocked over," the robot will have to have completely passed the Object (all parts of the robot past the Object's horizontal position.) Points to this effect will be counted based on the robot's position when the run ends.</li>
          <li>Teams will be ranked by total points and ties will be decided by time taken. </li>
          <li>Challenge details are subject to minor change as ambiguities are eliminated and any concerns raised.</li>
        </ol>
