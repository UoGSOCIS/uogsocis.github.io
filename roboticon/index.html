        <hr class="grey">
        <p>
          Roboticon is back for 2019 at College Royal at the University of Guelph! The University of Guelph would like to invite you to Roboticon 2019. This year's robot-building and programming challenge will be occurring on Saturday, March 16<sup>th</sup> and Sunday, March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2019 at the University of Guelph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roboticon is an annual event run in partnership with SOCIS and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/" >School of Computer Science</a>. It is an exciting opportunity for high school students to learn more about the field of Computer Science by designing and building <b>LEGO Mindstorms</b> robots to complete a series of challenges designed by our undergraduate students. Under strict rules and time limits, teams of students are challenged to build and program robots by sharpening teamwork skills and performing set tasks against a field of competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Our First Place winners will receive a brand new LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit and we will be giving away Second and Third Place LEGO gift card prizes! There will also be raffle prizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This event is open to <b>all high school students!</b> Roboticon is a completely free event to attend. The School of Computer Science will loan and mail out LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kits to teams that register on a first come, first serve basis. All meals will be provided. Get a team and a teacher together to register your team!
        </p>
        <p>
        	Happy Building! <br>The Roboticon Team

        <h2>Event Format</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li>Teams of up to four high-school students will build and program
          robots using LEGO Mindstorms kits to compete in two challenges</li>
          <li>The first challenge will be posted below, so students will have the
          opportunity to get a head start on designs</li>
          <li>Upon arrival, the students will have time to build and test their
          designs on our practice track</li>
          <li>There will be two heats for the first challenge, with build time in
          between for students to tweak and update their designs</li>
          <li>The second challenge will be presented at the end of the first day
          of competition, with two heats occurring on the second day</li>
          <li>Winners and prizes will be announced!</li>

              The Avengers are facing their greatest foe yet and only you can help them save the world!
          </p>
          <p>
          	Your first mission as an Avenger is a recon mission. Vision has created a map of the lines of sight for each guard on duty. Sneak past each guard’s circle of awareness to the enemy headquarters and retrieve the enemy battle plans. Slip into the guard’s vision and the alarm will be set, sealing away the plans for good.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Return back to safety with the plans, avoiding each guard to aid in the battle against Thanos.
      	  </p>
          <p>
          	You are the Avengers only hope!

              A new mission from the Avengers is ready for you!

          	Thanos’ minions have placed beacons to relay information back and
            forth between planets. Sabotage just enough beacons to delay the transfer
            of information without alerting security.
          </p>

          <p>
              Good luck, the fate of the universe hangs in the balance!
