    <h2 class="indent">Our Role in the School of Computer Science</h2>

    <p class="lead">Computer Science students have a voice inside the
    department and that voice is SOCIS. At least one of our executives is at
    every department meeting giving input on the topics discussed at the
    meeting. This has far reaching affects on topics like the future
    curriculum provided to CS and S. ENG majors. We also help the department
    to run events like the annual SOCS barbeque held every year in September
    to help welcome first year CS students to the University.</p>

    <h2 class="indent">Events</h2>

    <p class="lead">We run events to bring CS students closer
    together.</p>Every year SOCIS runs a number of events like Hackathons,
    LANs and movie nights that help to bring CS students closer together and
    build community in our small but growing College. You can keep up to date
    on these events through this site, our Facebook<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/UoGSOCIS/">group</a>, or our
    email<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O3K63UpMSTVm5h1UzydnRTddowNPeq0glZ3wkLazpL8/viewform">newsletter</a>.<br>

    We also send team(s) to<a href="http://csgames.org/">CS Games</a> every
    year to compete against other schools. And we help to sponsor a trip
    to<a href="http://cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> for any students that want to go.
    Finally every year SOCIS students are the driving force behind one of the
    largest<a href="www.collegeroyalsociety.com">College Royale</a>
    events,<a href="/roboticon/">Roboticon</a>.
