        We are a group of Computer Science students dedicated to
        bettering the CS community at the University of Guelph. We work closely
        with the <a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer
        Science</a> in planning the future of the School of Computer Science with
        our focus on benefitting students. We also run community building events
        and manage the CS Lounge in Reynolds 102.

      <h2>Our Role in the School of Computer Science</h2>
      <p>
        Computer Science students have a voice inside the department and that
        voice is SOCIS. At least one of our executives is at every department
        meeting to give student input on the topics discussed. This has far
        reaching effects on important topics like the future curriculum provided to CS and S.
        ENG majors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we also help the department to run events like the annual SOCS
        barbeque held every year in September to help welcome first year CS
        students to the University.

      <h2>Events</h2>
      <p class="lead">We run events to bring CS students closer together.</p>
      <p>Every year SOCIS runs a number of events like Hackathons, LANs
      and movie nights that help to bring CS students closer together and build
      community in our small but growing College. You can keep up to date on
      these events through this site, our Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/UoGSOCIS/">group</a>,
      or our email <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O3K63UpMSTVm5h1UzydnRTddowNPeq0glZ3wkLazpL8/viewform">
        newsletter</a>.</p>

      <p class="lead">CS Games</p>
      <p>
        Each year we send team(s) to compete in the <a href="http://csgames.org/">CS Games</a>,
        a computer science competition meant for university students from around North America.
        Competitions range from Computer Science related activities such as debugging or AI, to
        more non-computer related festivities like sports or video games.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">CUSEC</p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of each year we raise the funding necessary to send students to the
        annual <a href="http://cusec.net/">CUSEC conference</a>. Whether students are interested in
        the event speakers, the on-site hackathon or simply just want to find a potential employer,
        CUSEC can offer them the best opportunities. Due to the conference being sponsored by the likes
        of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and more (all of which attend looking to hire), CUSEC is one
        of the best places for computer science students to go job hunting.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">Roboticon</p>
      <p>
        Finally, every year SOCIS students are the driving force behind one of the
        largest <a href="www.collegeroyalsociety.com">College Royale</a>
        events, <a href="/roboticon/">Roboticon</a>.
