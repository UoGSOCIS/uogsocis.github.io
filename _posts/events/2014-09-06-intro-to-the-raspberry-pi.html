      <p>Let's explore the awesome new microcomputer you'll be using for Introduction to Computing.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Postponed: </b> Due to the delay of the shipping for the Raspberry PIs, this event will be postponed until after CIS*1500 students have access to their PIs. <b>However,</b> for anyone who still wants to attend the event at this time, Ryan and Nick from the exec team will still be available at the Thornborough Atrium as originally planned.
