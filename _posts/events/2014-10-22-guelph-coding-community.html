        GCC Tech Talks are events designed to showcase what your fellow students in SOCS are doing and maybe to even share some knowledge. Check the site regularly for more updates on who will be speaking and what content will be covered.
      </p>
      <p>Andrew Welton: A talk about starting an ambitious project in a language I've never used and in complex territory (think reading thesis papers). I will go over how I went about getting the project actually completed, the challenges and hurdles we faced and how we overcame them.</p>
      <p>Anuj Bhatia: The goal of the presentation is to teach people about creating their own WordPress theme instead of buying ones or using free ones which can be difficult to customize because you don't know their code. I want to show them how to organize their code in order for Wordpress to recognize it.</p>
      <p>Hugo Possani: A talk about sonification, a project to help teach the blind mathematical and statistical concepts through the use of technology and audio.</p>
      <p>As always there will be plenty of time for socializing after the talks as well. Hope to see everyone there!</p>
