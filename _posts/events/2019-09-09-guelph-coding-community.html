        GCC Tech Talks are events designed to showcase what your fellow students in SoCS are doing and maybe to even share some knowledge. We've got three awesome talks lined up:
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Marshall Asch will be doing a workshop on how to use basic commandline commands and an introduction to git.
        If you want to learn how to be one of the awesome people in movies who furiously press buttons on a keyboard while the FBI
        stands behind them and they find the bad guys location on a map then this is the talk for you! Come with a laptop with a unix like
        environment (Mac, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) or with a way to connect to the school server.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>As always there will be plenty of time for socializing after the talks as well. Hope to see everyone there!</p>
