        <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>

        <p>
            Hackathons are learning focused invention marathons where participants
            dream up fun, interesting projects and work in small teams to bring them
            to life over the course of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're not working on your project, there are plenty of other things
            to do like attending educational workshops, making friends, or showing off
            what you're learning or building. At Local Hack Day you can do these with
            other participants at your location or participants around the world at
            other locations!
        </p>
