        <a href="https://feedingninebillion.com/">Feeding Nine Billion</a> in association with the Food Institute of the University of Guelph and SOCIS, presents the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.ca/e/food-waste-hackathon-tickets-13091901229">Food Waste Hackathon</a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>On November 8th and 9th 2014, teams of University of Guelph students will compete to create a dynamic programming and marketing solution to a food waste issue.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Students will gather in the Summerlee Science Complex Atrium where they will be introduced to the problem before the competition clock starts at 11am. Students then have 24 hours to develop both strategic, and software solutions to the problem.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Team sizes range from two to four students and must include at least one student from the School of Computer Science and one student from a separate college.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Technical and issue expert “evangelists” will be on site to give guidance, and the results will be judged for a series of exciting prizes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Meals will be provided to registered teams, and team making will be facilitated at pre-event (details to be announced).</p>
      <br>
