      <p>We are a group of computer science students for computer science
      students. We coordinate with the <a href="http://www.socs.uoguelph.ca/">School of Computer Science</a> in
      planning the future of Computer Science at Guelph. We also manage a
      number of services for students like the CS lounge which is a space for
